## Tool design.

In order to design a tool for IRB140, the Robot catalog and manual was checked, in there we find some design planes usefull to elaborate the tool;

For the development of the tool we took into account the dimensions of the flange on the tool, which are provided in the manual of the robot, this in order to ensure the proper attachment conditions of our tool to the flank of the IRB140. The tool has a simple geometry, aiming for an efficient and economical design, it is worth mentioning that the design was made in 3D printing using PLA.

The following shows the components and dimensions of the tool.
