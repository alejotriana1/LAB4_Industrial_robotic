## Tool design.

In order to design a tool for IRB140, the Robot catalog and manual was checked, in there we find some design planes usefull to elaborate the tool;

For the development of the tool we took into account the dimensions of the flange on the tool, which are provided in the manual of the robot, this in order to ensure the proper attachment conditions of our tool to the flank of the IRB140. The tool has a simple geometry, aiming for an efficient and economical design, it is worth mentioning that the design was made in 3D printing using PLA.
The following shows the components and dimensions of the tool.

## Tool calibration.
The calibration of the tool can be done in two ways, the first way, the manual way where we already have the tool installed on the robot, with the help of the FlexPendant we will create a new variable where the calibration will be stored.


## Simulation in Robot studio. 

Firstly the movement was designed in a piece of paper with some measures and key points; moreover is really important to check the dimensional space where the tool can write over the board.

Afterwards, the key points were set to construct the letters, with this positional information the letters were set as targets in robotstudio. It's important to set up the correct robot and controller in the station Btw.

As a result the following path was obtained




## Calibration and Robot control.   (video) (we don't have a video o_O ... Well from the part of the tool calibration) --Pictures... Nop ... we have.... NOTHING about calibration, only our words :D


## issues 

At the moment the module was loading the flex pendant has shown some problems with the tool

## Conclutions.
